  <h2>Day 59</h2>
  <p>It was project day on Day 59, and we were asked to make a palindrome detector. I used a LOT of debugging and no<a href="#smalltext">*</a> help from Replit AI to finally complete it!</p>

  <h2>Day 63</h2>
  <p>On Day 63, we learned how to import our own Python modules. I used my palindrome detector code as a module from day 59!</p>

  <h2>Day 45</h2>
  <p>It was project day on day 45, and we created our ultimate to-do list! I really liked the styling, the saving to files, and the general satisfication of the project, with zero<a href="#smalltext">*</a> help from Replit AI!</p>

  <h2>Day 50</h2>
  <p>It was project day on Day 50, and we were asked to make an idea generator. I really liked the saving to file proccess with the lists, and it was an overall simple but useful system to help me daydream when I don't have any ideas.</p>

  <h2>Day 56</h2>
  <p>On day 56, we were asked to create a program that sorts songs into the authors appropriate folder. It was a little bit hard, but actually quite fun!</p>
